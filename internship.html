        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>Throughout the summer of 2020, I worked as a User Experience Design Intern for Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/teams/ddg">Devices Design Group</a> on the Alexa Core CX team, which focused on creating integral experiences for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?&node=9818047011&tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=570444916768&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11144874969816362834&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031944&hvtargid=kwd-313140753014&ref=pd_sl_7ipzmdukpb_e">Alexa Echo Show devices</a> through both touch and voice modalities. 

            <br><br>Throughout my 12 week internship, I was focused on creating a personalized, timely, and relevant landing screen for customers (screen 1) that customers interact with on their device. The goal of my project was to create a landing page that provided users with the right info at the right time. I will share my high level project and what I learned from the internship. <b>Please contact me if you want to learn more about this case study.</b>

        <h2>PROCESS</h2>
            <img class="timeline" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc9cf3gFGpxRdL_qy_9-iPphSpWGJ8HJSs-FYZo8SRBfELjZGGzlq42cS2rmxr96_MF7EEaWvldFNO01ByxTdShcPRGc8Nus6AhMJotKNQT-Mh2y6XUYphCVE4EQwD6pptL3wtuF2Y0qrFFXAfNT3YaiJw=w1596-h246-s-no?authuser=0">

        <h2>Define</h2>
        <p><b>Problem Statement</b><br>In the define phase, I developed a specific user problem opportunity within the product to solve for. To define this problem, I completed a series of deliverables including an internal audit of the product, a competitor audit of what customers are lacking or enjoying in the market, and wrote a formal project brief to define the problem statement. </p>
        
        <h2><br>Research</h2>
        <p><b>Discovery</b><br>This phase was all about discovering who I am designing for and how to best design for them. I dove deeper into the existing research related to my topic to create personas on potential users of my feature. The personas helped uncover what Tenets I should create to help guide my designing and ease future decision making.</p>


        <p><b>Content</b><br>Now that I had defined the problem and better understood the user, it was time to uncover how I would solve the opportunity gap. I began another audit of the Alexa Design System to see what existing components could be used to help formulate a design solution. </p>


        <h2><br>Ideate & Design</h2>
        <p><b>Model Concepting and Wireframes</b><br>While I was gathering pieces of the puzzle in the content stage, in the model phase I began to piece together potential solutions. This involved rounds of wireframing and thinking broadly to explore all possible solutions. I created three potential concepts for this project, and narrowed down on one for testing. </p>

        <h2><br>Validate</h2>
        <p><b>Testing</b><br>After I narrowed down the best designs, I went out to my customers and began to collect data on how these proposed solutions are honing in on the problem at hand. I created a research usability plan and conducted 5 interviews to collect my feedback. </p>

        <h2><br>PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Since my internship was coming to an end, it was time to wrap up on my project and deliver my recommendations for the landing screen on Alexa Echo Family Devices. I created a slidedeck and presented to key stakeholders my findings and recommendations. The work that I delivered throughout my 12 week internship directly influenced the design and creation of Widgets for Echo Show devices. Unfortunately, I can't show my final design work here, but don't hesitate to contact me to discuss my project! </p>
