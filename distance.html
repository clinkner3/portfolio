        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>During the testing of multimodal products by Amazon UX researchers, valuable customer feedback regarding cognitive capacity had been discovered.
            Alexa products lacked a clear approach to alleviating cognitive load for customers. To address the cognitive overload experienced by customers using multimodal products,
            the concept of Distance Customer Experience (Distance CX) was proposed. Distance CX is a brand new feature on Echo Show devices which aims to give customers the ideal experience at every distance.
            This helps create a more distinct and intentional near-field vs far-field modality experience for customers based on screen size and viewing context.
            Distance CX is the first of it’s kind to tackle how sensory surroundings should impact our design decisions, meaning there was no precedent set in the Alexa design system for how to approach proximity as a trigger for screen shifts.
            This is the first time that Echo Family Devices (EFD) would be changing any experience on screen based on cognitive limits and environmental stimuli. To ensure the success of this novel feature, we had to establish all new rules, goals, tenets, and definitions for this feature.
            Once the foundations of the experience were established, we then needed to find a way to integrate it with our current design system. As the UX Designer, I contributed to various aspects of the project, including product strategy, design concepting, user research, interaction design, and visual design.

        <h2>PROCESS</h2>
            <img class="timeline" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc9cf3gFGpxRdL_qy_9-iPphSpWGJ8HJSs-FYZo8SRBfELjZGGzlq42cS2rmxr96_MF7EEaWvldFNO01ByxTdShcPRGc8Nus6AhMJotKNQT-Mh2y6XUYphCVE4EQwD6pptL3wtuF2Y0qrFFXAfNT3YaiJw=w1596-h246-s-no?authuser=0">

        <h2>01<br>Define</h2>
        <p><b>Problem Statement</b><br>In the define phase, I developed a specific user problem opportunity within the product to solve for. To define this problem, I completed a series of deliverables including an internal audit of the product, a competitor audit of what customers are lacking or enjoying in the market, and wrote a formal project brief to define the problem statement. </p>
        
        <h2>02<br>Research</h2>
        <div class="info"><p><b>Discovery</b><br>This phase was all about discovering who I am designing for and how to best design for them. I dove deeper into the existing research related to my topic to create personas on potential users of my feature. The personas helped uncover what Tenets I should create to help guide my designing and ease future decision making.</p></div>

        <div class="info">
            <p><b>Content</b><br>Now that I had defined the problem and better understood the user, it was time to uncover how I would solve the opportunity gap. I began another audit of the Alexa Design System to see what existing components could be used to help formulate a design solution. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>03 / 04<br>Ideate & Design</h2>
        <p><b>Model Concepting and Wireframes</b><br>While I was gathering pieces of the puzzle in the content stage, in the model phase I began to piece together potential solutions. This involved rounds of wireframing and thinking broadly to explore all possible solutions. I created three potential concepts for this project, and narrowed down on one for testing. </p>

        <h2>05<br>Validate</h2>
        <p><b>Testing</b><br>After I narrowed down the best designs, I went out to my customers and began to collect data on how these proposed solutions are honing in on the problem at hand. I created a research usability plan and conducted 5 interviews to collect my feedback. </p>

        <h2>PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Since my internship was coming to an end, it was time to wrap up on my project and deliver my recommendations for the landing screen on Alexa Echo Family Devices. I created a slidedeck and presented to key stakeholders my findings and recommendations. The work that I delivered throughout my 12 week internship directly influenced the design and creation of Widgets for Echo Show devices. Unfortunately, I can't show my final design work here, but don't hesitate to contact me to discuss my project! </p>
